# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To configure the environment variables, you can copy the `.env.example` file and replace the values of `REACT_APP_API_KEY` and
`REACT_APP_API_TOKEN` with the ones provided by tmdb's API (see the [documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)). If the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_BASE_URL` was changed, it will need to be updated as well.

In order to test front and backend integration, it is possible to select the checkbox shwon on the Kendo Grid and click on the floating action button to send the selected list of movies to the backend application.
